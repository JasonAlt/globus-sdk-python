Contributing to the Globus SDK
==============================

First off, thank you so much for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

Reporting Bugs & Requesting Features
------------------------------------

  - Check if there's a matching
      https://github.com/globus/globus-sdk-python/issues[issue]
      before opening a new issue or pull request
  - When possible, provide a code sample to reproduce bugs

Linting & Testing
-----------------

- All code is autoformatted with https://github.com/ambv/black[black] and
   https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort[isort]. You may run
    `make autoformat` to do this or configure these tools for use in your
    editor.
- Code must pass `make lint`, which checks that autoformatting is clean and
    that `flake8` passes
- All code must pass `make test`

NOTE: `black` requires python3.6, so you may find it necessary to
`make clean autoformat PYTHON_VERSION=python3.6` or equivalent.

Expectations for Pull Requests
------------------------------

  - *Make sure it merges cleanly*. We may request that you rebase if your PR
      has merge conflicts.
  - *List any issues closed by the pull request*
  - *Squash intermediate and fixup commits*. We recommend running
    `git rebase --interactive` prior to submitting a pull request.

These are our guidelines for good commit messages:

  - No lines over 72 characters
  - No GitHub emoji -- use your words
  - Reference issues and pull requests where appropriate
  - Present tense and imperative mood

Additional Recommendations
--------------------------

  - Try to use raw strings for docstrings -- ensures that ReST won't be
      confused by characters like `\\`
  - Use examples very liberally in documentation
  - Show where you imported from within the SDK. Start at least one example with
      `from globus_sdk.modulename import ClassName` on a page with docs for
      `ClassName`
  - Think very hard before adding a new dependency -- keep the dependencies of
      `globus_sdk` as lightweight as possible
