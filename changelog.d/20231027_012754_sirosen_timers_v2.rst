Added
~~~~~

- Add support for the new Transfer Timer creation method, in the form of a
  client method, ``TimerClient.create_timer``, and a payload builder type,
  ``TransferTimer`` (:pr:`887`)

  - ``create_timer`` only supports dict data and ``TransferTimer``, not the
    previous ``TimerJob`` type

  - Additional helper classes, ``RecurringTimerSchedule`` and
    ``OneceTimerSchedule``, are provided to help build the ``TransferTimer``
    payload

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

- Creation of timers to run transfers using ``TimerJob`` is now
  deprecated (:pr:`887`)
