Helper Objects
--------------

The ``TimerJob`` class is used to set up request data to send to Timer for
creating a recurring job. Currently only recurring transfers are supported.
Thus, a ``TimerJob`` should not be initialized directly; use the
``from_transfer_data`` method to construct one to start a Timer job to run a
transfer. This will require having a :class:`TransferClient
<globus_sdk.TransferClient>` instantiated firstâ€”see the Transfer service docs
for details and examples.

Client Errors
-------------

When an error occurs, a ``TimerClient`` will raise specifically a ``TimerAPIError``
rather than just a ``GlobusAPIError``.
